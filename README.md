ChatGPT:  
In conclusion, the provided code is well-written and adheres to modern ASP.NET Core conventions.
The structure (Program -> DI configuration -> Controllers -> Services) is clean and maintainable.
Dependency injection is used properly to manage configurations and external clients, and the code avoids any obvious anti-patterns.
The custom console startup logic is a bit unconventional for a web project, but it's implemented carefully and doesn't introduce errors in the context it's used.  

User:  
Thank you for your review.
I use ConsoleController for developer tool only.
I will rewrite this console app to web app in the future.  

ChatGPT:  
You're welcome! Your current setup is excellent as a developer tool and clearly structured for future transitions.
When you're ready to rewrite it as a web application, your clear separation between controllers and services will make that transition straightforward.
